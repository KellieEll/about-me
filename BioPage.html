  	Despite the name, Kellie Autumn Ell, Kellie was actually born in the summer. Her mother, a Florida native, met a cute boy from Connecticut many moons ago. As the story goes, the duo fell for each other, and the young lady packed her bags and followed him to New England. When she arrived in the small Connecticut town for the first time she fell in love with the explosion of colors. “We don’t have these where I’m from,” she said, and named her daughter, who would be born there a few years later, after her favorite time of year.

  	<br>
  	
<p>
Fast forward and grown-up Kellie is a journalist who has traveled the globe, from Asia to South America to Europe, as well as throughout the United States for work and pleasure, and in the process has developed new perspectives on the world.
</p>
<br>

<p>
After high school, she traded in the East Coast to study journalism and American Sign Language in San Francisco. In the City by the Bay, Kellie found a place that celebrated diversity like no other. After college she worked in the nation’s capital and spent time in Peru sharpening her Spanish-language skills. Upon returning to the West Coast, she wrote for various publications, including the Nob Hill Gazette magazine, San Francisco Chronicle and the Oakland Tribune.

<p>
In 2011, a combination of wanderlust and curiosity once again propelled her to try something new — this time to another continent. Kellie spent more than three years in South Korea, working as the sole American in a large-scale Korean company and as a freelance journalist.
</p>
<br>

<p>
In 2015 Kellie returned to the United States, but once again took up residence in a new locale. This time in the Heartland — Nebraska to be exact. In the year and a half that followed, Kellie traveled the nation, working as a reporter, writer, photographer and social media content creator for an independent news agency, covering business trends for a variety of publications throughout the United States, as well as Canada.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Now in New York City, Kellie is a freelance journalist as well as a graduate student at City University of New York's Graduate School of Journalism in Manhattan where she is learning data journalism and coding. Kellie is interested in covering health, science, wellness, finance, women's issues and South Korea — her second home. (She promised her grandmother she would one day write a book about her time on the peninsula.) Kellie is also on the board of the Asian American Journalists Association's New York Chapter.

<p>
When not pursuing journalism Kellie can be found riding her bicycle through Brooklyn's Prospect Park.
